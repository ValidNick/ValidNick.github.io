            <p> Hi, My name is Nicholas Munsie as you can see from my profile to the right and ValidNick is my github username. 
           I like to code hence how I created this page and I am well versed in front end and little bit of back end web development. 
           As for things about myself outside of coding, I like to play sports, such as basketball, play games and read books. 
           Some of my other hobbies also include trying new things and to fruther pushing myself either in coding such as for games or
           even fun short little programs or even as physical as modeling! Check below to see some of my projects. </p>
